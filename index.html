        <h4 class="Heading">Founder of Microsoft</h4>
        <div class="info">
          <p>The original purpose of Microsoft was to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800,
            an early personal computer developed by MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems).
            BASIC (Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was a popular programming language at
            the time, and Microsoft’s version allowed users to write and execute programs on the Altair 8800
            efficiently.</p>
          <h4 class="Heading">Windows</h4>
          <p>The first version of Microsoft Windows, Windows 1.0, was released on November 20, 1985. Its
            primary purpose was to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that made personal computing
            more user-friendly and accessible, especially for people who were used to command-line
            interfaces.</p>
          <h4 class="Heading">Microsoft Office</h4>
          <p>Microsoft Office was first released on August 1, 1989, for Macintosh computers and later for
            Windows in 1990. Microsoft Office was created to provide a suite of productivity applications
            that help users create, edit, and manage documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails.</p>
          <h4 class="Heading">Internet Explorer</h4>
          <p>Internet Explorer (IE) was created by Microsoft and first released on August 16, 1995. Its
            purpose was web browsing, integration with Windows, competition with Netscape, and support for
            web technologies.</p>
